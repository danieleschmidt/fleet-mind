## Success Metrics

### Publication Goals
- Target: 3 top-tier publications accepted
- Expected citations: 100+ within 2 years
- Media coverage: Technical press and academic news
- Awards: Best paper nominations

### Impact Goals
- Open-source adoption by research community
- Industry licensing inquiries
- Follow-up research by other groups
- Integration into production systems

## Risk Mitigation

### Common Rejection Reasons
- Insufficient novelty → Emphasize quantum/neuromorphic innovations
- Limited experimental validation → Provide extensive statistical analysis
- Unclear practical applications → Highlight real-world use cases
- Missing related work → Comprehensive literature review

### Backup Plans
- Secondary venues identified for each paper
- Conference workshop submissions as fallback
- ArXiv preprints for early visibility
- Industry conferences for practical impact
