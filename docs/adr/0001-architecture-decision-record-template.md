# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Record Template

## Status

Template - Not a decision

## Context

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are a lightweight way to document important architectural decisions and their context. This template provides a consistent format for all Fleet-Mind ADRs.

## Decision

We will use this template for all architectural decisions in Fleet-Mind:

### Title Format
`ADR-XXXX: [Brief Decision Summary]`

### Required Sections

1. **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
2. **Context**: The architectural challenge or choice we're facing
3. **Decision**: What we decided to do and why
4. **Consequences**: The positive and negative impacts of this decision

### Optional Sections
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options we evaluated
- **Implementation Notes**: Technical details for implementation
- **References**: Links to relevant documentation or research

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent documentation format across the project
- Clear traceability of architectural decisions
- Easier onboarding for new team members
- Historical context for future decision making

### Negative
- Additional overhead for documenting decisions
- Requires discipline to maintain consistency

## Implementation Notes

- Store ADRs in `docs/adr/` directory
- Number ADRs sequentially (0001, 0002, etc.)
- Use Markdown format for easy version control
- Reference ADRs in code comments when relevant
- Review ADRs during architecture reviews
