# Fleet-Mind Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Fleet-Mind - Realtime Swarm LLM  
**Project Type**: Open Source Software Platform  
**Start Date**: January 2025  
**Initial Release Target**: Q4 2025  

## Problem Statement

Current drone swarm coordination systems face fundamental limitations:

1. **Scalability Bottlenecks**: Existing systems cannot coordinate 100+ drones in real-time
2. **High Latency**: Traditional command-and-control approaches introduce 1000ms+ delays
3. **Limited Intelligence**: Rule-based systems cannot adapt to complex, dynamic environments
4. **Bandwidth Constraints**: Full action transmission requires 10MB/s per drone
5. **Fault Intolerance**: Single points of failure compromise entire swarm operations

These limitations prevent deployment of large-scale autonomous drone swarms for critical applications like search and rescue, precision agriculture, and infrastructure monitoring.

## Vision Statement

**"Enable intelligent coordination of massive drone swarms through LLM-powered planning and ultra-low latency communication, democratizing access to scalable autonomous systems."**

## Mission Statement

Fleet-Mind delivers a real-time coordination platform that:
- Orchestrates 100+ drones with <100ms end-to-end latency
- Uses Large Language Models for intelligent, adaptive planning
- Achieves 100:1 bandwidth reduction through latent action encoding
- Provides fault-tolerant operation with distributed consensus
- Integrates seamlessly with existing robotics infrastructure (ROS 2)
